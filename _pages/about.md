# **About Me**
Hi, I'm Guanchen Wu! I am currently a second-year Master's student majoring in computer science at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html). I received my B.S. degree from the Department of Computer Science at the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/) in March 2023.

My research interests span large language models (LLMs), AI4Health, and graph data mining. Recently, I've begun exploring LLM agents and multimodal models for healthcare.

You can find my CV here: [Guanchen Wu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV.pdf).
