# **About Me**
Hi, I'm Guanchen Wu! I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Carl Yang](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/). I earned my M.S. degree in Computer Science from [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html) in May 2025 and received B.S. degree in Computer Science from the [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/) in March 2023.

My research interests span AI4Health, large language models (LLMs), and graph data mining. Recently, I've begun exploring LLM agents and multimodal models for healthcare.

You can find my CV here: [Guanchen Wu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV.pdf).
