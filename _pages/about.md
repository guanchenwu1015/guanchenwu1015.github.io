# **About Me**
Hi, I'm Guanchen Wu! I am currently a second-year Master's student majoring in computer science at [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html). I received my B.S. degree from the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine, in March 2023.

My research interests span graph data mining, artificial intelligence, and large language models (LLMs) for health. Recently, I've begun exploring LLM agents and machine learning models for broader applications, such as healthcare.

You can find my CV here: [Guanchen Wu's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
